                        <p class="lead">Everything we do is about people – whether that is ensuring we link the homeless persons with
                            a good quality, safe home or helping this vulnerable group of people to live an independent
                            life. Birmingham Shelters links the various accommodation to homeless persons of all ages
                            and difficulties or diagnoses in all sections of the Birmingham community. We provide a
                            safe, secure platform to match-up Birmingham’s empty supported accommodation rooms with
                            those who need them. We intend to help fill empty rooms as these rooms were not properly
                            advertised before.</p>
