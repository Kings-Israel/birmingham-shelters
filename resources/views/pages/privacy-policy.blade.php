                        <p>
                            We use personal data in line with the principles set out in the data protection legislation,
                            including the requirement to only use your personal information for the purposes it was
                            collected and to use appropriate technical and organisational measures to keep your
                            information secure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We rely on our legitimate interests to use the personal data that we collect for our
                            internal monitoring and evaluation purposes. This includes preparing reports about the
                            number of homeless people who have reached out and their needs, and the action taken as a
                            result. Moreover, we will also keep records of the social landlords and the accommodation
                            that they register with us. These reports are statistical and do not include any personal
                            data from which individuals can be identified. They will only be used to match the homeless
                            persons with the rightly suited supported accommodation.
