                                    internal monitoring and evaluation purposes. This includes preparing reports about the
                                    number of homeless people who have reached out and their needs, and the action taken as a
                                    result. Moreover, we will also keep records of the social landlords and the accommodation
                                    that they register with us. These reports are statistical and do not include any personal
                                    data from which individuals can be identified. They will only be used to match the homeless
