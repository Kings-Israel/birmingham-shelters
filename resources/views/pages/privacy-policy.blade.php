                                    internal monitoring and evaluation purposes. This includes preparing reports about the
                                    number of homeless people who have reached out and their needs, and the action taken as a
                                    result. Moreover, we will also keep records of the social landlords and the accommodation

                                    data from which individuals can be identified. They will only be used to match the homeless
