                        help the homeless people find a suitable accommodation that will meet their needs. In addition,
                        we ensure that the accommodations are a safe and secure environment for the homeless persons. We
                        work with social landlord whose properties have been inspected and cleared by the Birmingham
                        Voluntary Services Council (BVSC) ensuring high-quality service is provided. In supported
                        housing, accommodation is provided alongside care, support, or supervision to help people live
                        as independently as possible. <strong>
